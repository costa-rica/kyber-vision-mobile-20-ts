# This is reference of all the changes

## Start project and mods prior to Claude Code (commit 977feab96a5d82cd4f3c7493f56cbd37cfb432c4)

- started project with `npx create-expo-app@latest`
- created README.md and docs/ to provide context for the TS conversion
- the app ran and displayed the SplashScreen - not fully filled out
- "Classic" navigation

## Implement user reducer and corresponding App.tsx mods (commit 22547b97880f375832e7e011b8cc70e35183409a)

Completed Tasks:

1. Created TypeScript user reducer (src/reducers/user.ts):

   - Converted from JavaScript with proper TypeScript types
   - Added interfaces for UserState, ContractTeamUser, and all payload types
   - Maintained all the original functionality from the reference file

2. Fixed App.tsx:

   - Corrected the import path for the user reducer
   - Installed required Redux dependencies
   - Created a centralized store configuration in src/types/store.ts
   - Updated App.tsx to use the typed store and persistor

3. Updated Splash.tsx:

   - Added the userReducer const using useSelector hook
   - Added proper TypeScript typing with RootState
   - Added a simple display to show login status based on the token

4. Type checking passed: No TypeScript errors when running npm run typecheck

The user reducer is now properly implemented and can be imported and used throughout the app. The Redux store is set
up with persistence for the user reducer only (as in the original), and the Splash screen now has access to the
user state through the userReducer selector.
