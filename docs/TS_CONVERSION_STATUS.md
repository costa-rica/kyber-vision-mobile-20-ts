# This is reference of all the changes

## Start project and mods prior to Claude Code (commit 977feab96a5d82cd4f3c7493f56cbd37cfb432c4)

- started project with `npx create-expo-app@latest`
- created README.md and docs/ to provide context for the TS conversion
- the app ran and displayed the SplashScreen - not fully filled out
- "Classic" navigation

## Implement user reducer and corresponding App.tsx mods (commit 22547b97880f375832e7e011b8cc70e35183409a)

Completed Tasks:

1. Created TypeScript user reducer (src/reducers/user.ts):

   - Converted from JavaScript with proper TypeScript types
   - Added interfaces for UserState, ContractTeamUser, and all payload types
   - Maintained all the original functionality from the reference file

2. Fixed App.tsx:

   - Corrected the import path for the user reducer
   - Installed required Redux dependencies
   - Created a centralized store configuration in src/types/store.ts
   - Updated App.tsx to use the typed store and persistor

3. Updated Splash.tsx:

   - Added the userReducer const using useSelector hook
   - Added proper TypeScript typing with RootState
   - Added a simple display to show login status based on the token

4. Type checking passed: No TypeScript errors when running npm run typecheck

The user reducer is now properly implemented and can be imported and used throughout the app. The Redux store is set
up with persistence for the user reducer only (as in the original), and the Splash screen now has access to the
user state through the userReducer selector.

## Implemented Splash.tsx and offline data (commit 138702de9569f1317d234c716e410321c69aefab )

### 1. Created ButtonKvStd Component (`src/components/buttons/ButtonKvStd.tsx`)

- **Converted from JavaScript reference**: Translated `docs/kyber-vision-mobile-18-ref/screens/subcomponents/buttons/ButtonKvStd.js` to TypeScript
- **Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces**:
  - `ButtonKvStdProps` interface with proper typing for all props
  - Type-safe merging of default and custom styles
  - Proper handling of `ViewStyle` and `TextStyle` types
- **Enhanced functionality**:
  - Added `disabled` prop with visual feedback (grayed out appearance)
  - Improved type safety for animation and style handling
  - Maintained original animation behavior (scale effect on press)

### 2. Created Offline Data Structure (`src/data/`)

- **Established TypeScript data files** corresponding to each reducer:
  - `userReducerOffline.ts` - Guest user data with all wheel colors and text styles
  - `teamReducerOffline.ts` - Mock team data for offline testing
  - `scriptReducerOffline.ts` - Player data for scripting functionality
  - `reviewReducerOffline.ts` - Video and action data for review features
- **Maintained data structure compatibility** with original JSON files from `docs/kyber-vision-mobile-18-ref/offlineData/`
- **Added `as const` assertions** for improved type inference and immutability

### 3. Enhanced Splash Screen (`src/app/welcome/Splash.tsx`)

- **Full functionality conversion** from `docs/kyber-vision-mobile-18-ref/screens/SplashScreen.js`:
  - Implemented guest login with offline user data
  - Added registration and email login buttons (with TODO placeholders)
  - Included Google sign-in button (placeholder implementation)
  - Added logout functionality when user is logged in
- **Redux integration**:
  - `useSelector` hook to access user state
  - `useDispatch` for login/logout actions
  - `useEffect` to auto-navigate when user has token
- **Complete UI implementation**:
  - Responsive button styling using `Dimensions.get("window").width`
  - Proper layout with top/bottom containers
  - Visual separators and "or" text between login options
  - Version display (updated to 0.20.0)
- **Navigation enhancements**:
  - Added `SelectTeam` route to navigation types
  - Proper navigation flow based on authentication state

### 4. Dependencies and Configuration

- **Installed Redux packages**: `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`, `redux-persist`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- **Store configuration**: Centralized in `src/types/store.ts` with proper TypeScript typing
- **Type safety**: All components pass TypeScript checking with no errors

### 5. Key Improvements Over Original

- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Better organization**: Separated offline data into individual files by domain
- **Enhanced error handling**: TypeScript catches potential runtime issues
- **Improved maintainability**: Clear interfaces and type definitions
- **Modern React patterns**: Proper hook usage and functional components

The Splash screen now provides complete functionality matching the original JavaScript version while leveraging TypeScript's benefits for better code quality and developer experience.
